**Electronic Warfare**
======================
An Introduction to Electronic Warfare from the First Jamming to Machine Learning Techniques - River Publishers (2021) Chi-Hao Cheng, James Tsui
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Since its creation at the beginning of World War II, radars have forever transformed the practice of modern warfare. The evolution of countermeasure conducted by electronic warfare systems against radars and radars’ corresponding counter countermeasures is an intriguing technical subject.

 This book provides a very accessible introduction to a broad range of radar and electronic warfare technologies. The subjects covered in this book range from early radar development to later technologies such as stealthy techniques, low probability of intercept radar, and machine learning.

 Historical events are used to illustrate the principles of electronic warfare and to help readers to apprehend contexts under which radars and corresponding electronic warfare techniques were developed.

 **Not for teenagers [4/5]:** It was 1989 when i ordered this book out of the back of solder of fortune magazine. I was a 12 yr old farm boy from Ohio, who grew up with more guns available to us kids than most may have over a lifetime. We didnt play xbox, we killed things and blew up whatever wouldnt get us in trouble. Yes we had a respect for deadly things from an early age, something that i believe hunting and killing animals bestowed upon us as children. We seen how deadly munitions were and that it was for keeps with no take backs. This book is nice but detonation proves a problem for most. Leave the explosions to the professionals. These days they will lock you up just for thinking of making something like this, its no longer the way it was when i was having fun with this stuff.

**Jamming radio/radar communications**
======================================
Improvised Radio Jamming Techniques - Paladin Press (1989) Lawrence W. Myers
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 **Highly readable by a guy who knows his stuff [5/5]:** This book is for the man who thinks he might find it necessary some day to jam police or other radio systems. It is not overly technical or lacking technical details. In fact, it reads more like a combination of a how to book and a military manual.
 Some technical information is necessary. For example, if you don't know what an oscillator is or what it does in a receiver or transmitter, you could not hope to be an effective and hidden jammer.
 I enjoyed the book very much and consider it readable, interesting, and knowledgeable. In fact, although I read it strait through in a few nights, I'm keeping it for a reference. 
   
 `amazon.com <https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RDXIQTLV92WK8?ASIN=B01JXSTIDE>`_
  
|  
  
 **Not What You Would Expect [3/5]:** The title is horribly misleading. With a minimal portion of this book actually focusing on improvised jamming techniques, I was quite dissappointed. It explores the technical aspects of jamming far more than how someone would go about jamming signals.

World War II Axis Booby Traps and Sabotage Tactics - Osprey Publishing (2009) Gordon L. Rottman
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Booby traps laid by troops in war zones in World War II are largely neglected in histories and memoirs, and rarely examined in detail. Yet for a soldier, the threat of booby traps had to be at the forefront of his mind, and an ability to find and disarm them was essential. This is the first comprehensive study of World War II's battlefield booby traps, using information from rare wartime intelligence publications to identify, illustrate and describe the tactics of both Allied and Axis saboteurs. Examining all aspects of this secretive subject, from the equipment used to the techniques of placing and finding them, this book uncovers the daily risks faced by soldiers on the ground through the course of the war.
